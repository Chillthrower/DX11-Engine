# DX11-Engine

  I am building a DirectX11 graphics engine to learn the basics of graphics programming. The project is setup in a way, that you can clone it, open the solution with VS2022 and run it.
  
  
  Current learning project is to create a windows xp pipe simulation using the engine I built.
  
  
  The engine could possibly be converted into DirectX12 in the future since most of the code related to DirectX11 is the code that interracts with HLSL shaders, and manages vertex, constant buffer storage in VRAM. The reason for this conversion would be particularly aimed at Ray Tracing APIs in DirectX12.
